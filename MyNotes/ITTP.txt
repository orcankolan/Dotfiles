THESE ARE FOR HOST COMPUTER.. NOT FOR ARM PROCESSOR

FOR ITPP:

ITTP needs Blas, Lapack and FFTW (for fft functions to work)

For FFTW: install libfftw3-3 (on ubuntu), this installs runtime libraries: .so files, also it will add fortran compilers

For Blas and Lapack: install liblapack3 (on ubuntu), this installs lapack (including Blas) libraries: .so files

For ITPP: install libitpp-dev (on ubuntu), this will install header files for developing and it will prompt you to install
libitpp8v5 which installs itpp libraries, .so files.

when itpp is installing it will search for blas, lapack and fftw libraries. And it will find them, because they are:

- blas and lapack is in /usr/lib/
- fftw is in usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/, 

and these paths are in the search path of ldconfig: which can be seen by :

ldconfig -v 2>/dev/null | grep -v ^$'\t'


FOR QWT:

1-) You may install it manually by downloading (using make, and make install) (this must be the the right way) 
2-) Or you may install libqwt-qt5-dev ? (not sure)
