Qt Creator Locked Problem:

	-disable 3d acceleration from virtualbox settings and boot the system
	-In Qt Creator, go to Help › About Plugins…
	-Uncheck Qt Creator –> Welcome
	-exit Qt Creator, shutdown system and enable 3d acceleration
	-It should work now after reboot

QT CREATOR (In Ubuntu) SETTING A NEW KIT:

<tuple> is :  identifier of the architecture, vendor, operating system, C library and ABI. E.g:
									arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabihf

---The Buildroot cross-compiler is installed in $(HOST_DIR)/usr/bin 
(which is orcan@orcan-virtualbox:~/raspberry/git_jumpnow_repo/orcan1-output/host/usr/bin)

---Qmake is installed in $(HOST_DIR)/usr/bin

The sysroot is in host/<tuple>/sysroot/usr

Project under Qt-Projects/receiver-rpi3:

- open receiver.pro
- itpp.pri, picoscope.pri, receiver.pri are in the project folder (either in receiver or in receiver-rpi3), so they are configured for the 
ubunutu linux or rpi3 buildroot linux)
- QWT related files, i.e qwtbuild.pri, qwtconfigure.pri and qwtfunctions.pri are in the folder which is one level up
so you have to make changes for receiver and receiver-rpi3 in the qwtconfig.pri file (others are same for both receiver and reciever-rpi projects)

- under Projects => Manage Kits (or under Options => Build and Run):
	Device Type = Generic Linux (Host name = ip address of rpi3, user = root, password = blank ) 
	Sysroot = orcan1-output/host/usr/arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabihf/sysroot
	Compiler = orcan1-output/host/usr/bin/arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabihf-gcc
	Qmake = orcan1-output/host/usr/bin/qmake
	- Do not change debugger, qt mkspecs or cmake tool!

- before build change the QWT_INSTALL_PREFIX (in qwtconfig.pri file) for rpi3 sysroot
	QWT_INSTALL_PREFIX    = /home/orcan/raspberry/git_jumpnow_repo/orcan1-output/host/usr/arm-buildroot-linux-				gnueabihf/sysroot/usr
	

- if you gonna build for ubuntu make it QWT_INSTALL_PREFIX = /usr/local/qwt-$$QWT_VERSION

- build receiver-rpi3 project with this configuration then put the executable file receiver-rpi3 to rpi3 wtih sftp.
